# TypeScript Sandbox

This is a template project to evaluate code from TypeScript programming tips I regularly tweet about on my https://twitter.com/t_tarnowski account.

# Prerequisites

Code editor is also nice to have.
I recommend Visual Studio Code.

# How to download repository and set up the project

In your command line:

1. Go to directory with all your projects, for example:

cd ~/Projects
```

2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:ttarnowski/typescript-sandbox.git
```

3. Change directory to `typescript-sandbox`:
```
cd typescript-sandbox
```

4. And then, to install all the required TypeScript packages, run:
```
npm install
```

# Where to write code

Open the project with your code editor.

For Visual Studio Code:
1. From the menu on the top go to `File` -> `Open`.
2. Find the `typescript-sandbox` folder a click on the `Open` button.

Once you opened the project you can edit the code in `src/index.ts` file.

# How to run my code

For Visual Studio Code:
